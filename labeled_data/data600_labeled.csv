"It may be free to download the app, but it still costs to buy more farm cash. I've had this app for a couple months and love being able to play from my phone. I'm giving such a low rating because when there is a bug with the app, it appears Zynga does nothing at all. Even if the app is free, you guys still have sponsors. Customer service is still a priority (or at least it should be).<br/>I've been having problems all along, now I am going to record them here.<br/>9/16 sync problems<br/>9/18 sync problems<br/>9/21 - app won't load again.<br/>9/22 still won't load. All crops must be lost<br/>9/22 started to run (crops were lost) then stopped opening this evening<br/>9/22 now it opens, but within two minutes it stops syncing with Zynga, so I lose everything I have done and must repeat it<br/>9/29 sync problems returned<br/>10/02 more sync problems - shocking!<br/>10/11 sync problems, yet again<br/>11/11 this is new, but it's been going on for a few days: everytime I open the app, it makes me re-login to FB and then it either crashes or freeze.<br/>11/15 keeps crashing.<br/>1/19/11 Wow! It worked so well for two months, but now it won't sync again. Every time I do something, suddenly it won't sync, and it undoes all my work.<br/>2/20 won't even open<br/>3/17 unwither ring (cost me a lot of real money) does not work<br/>3/18 same as yesterday - I charged $50 to my credit card for that unwither ring<br/>3/19 app won't open<br/>3/20 app won't open<br/>3/21 app won't open<br/>3/30 For over a week, the unwither ring which cost about $50 real money (US currency) has not worked unless I first open the farm on my PC MAKING THE MOBILE APP USELESS. Zynga is impossible to get on touch with and had done nothing to fix this problem.<br/>3/31 unwither ring still not working<br/>4/17 unwither ring has not worked in weeks. Zynga is giving me the run-around. App also won't open today. I am about to quit game altogether.",1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Got hooked playing Virtual City and finished Paradise Resort. Had so much fun I started on this one and had built a great city. Then the developer issued an update that made the game not load. Several emails and little support later I still have a broken game. Spent real money and feel like an idiot. Hope that nothing happens to your game because you will recieve no support if it does.,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

"I have played several Zynga games and they all seem to be designed from the same mold. Fun at first but then it takes longer and longer to get &quot;energy&quot;, buy more &quot;land&quot;, get more &quot;animals&quot;, build more &quot;building&quot;, etc., etc.,.<br/>   I have enjoyed these games for a few weeks until the entire game slows down to the point where the only user choice is to start spending real money for virtual &quot;coins&quot;, &quot;hearts&quot;, or &quot;stars&quot;. Somebody needs to explain to me how I can have over 70,000 &quot;coins&quot; but still don't have enough to but a tree or cow, much less buy more property to expand my &quot;homestead&quot;. <br/>     So simple, with no more land I can't grow more crops, plant more trees, raise more animals and it appears I have reached a point after several weeks where if I want to finish this game I have only one choice- start spending lots of real money (virtual coins don't seem to have much real value, they just keep adding up but are pretty much useless when it comes to buying anything of value). Yes &quot;real money is what it takes to keep this, and many of the other Zynga games rolling. <br/>   After playing this game for a few weeks I feel like I've been visiting Las Vegas, you know how that goes, you spend tons of cash BUT THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS.  The tragedy here is this is really a cute and clever concept until greed rears its ugly head. <br/>     I would have MUCH preferred this game to be called &quot;FarmVille Lite&quot;, and at some point been given the option of just buying it for $10.00 and being done with it and then being able to play it over and over. I feel like Zynga has taken a game app worth $10.00 and decided to make it cost $50.00-$100.00 to play it. <br/>    I'm sorry Zynga, I choose not to shoot up with the new virtual drug. Give me a &quot;purchase game for $10.00&quot; option and I'll be happy. Otherwise, next time an app promo says &quot;tops in in app purchases&quot; just SAY NO. Think I'd rather go to Vegas, it's much more fun and when you're done, you're done.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0

"This is another game that costs to much real money to play, plus takes to long for things to build, and coins are slow to build up to buy buildings. Time limits too do a quest with times to build bridges, homes, etc don't give you much of an opportunity to finish quest in amount of time giving.

"It's a really fun, addicting game. One downfall is, like with most free apps, you end up having to spend real money one way or another. Once you get further on into the game, the &quot;goals&quot; they set up for you to do in order to unlock certain things and move up levels get ridiculously exspensive for you to acommplish, so you end up having to use realy money for virtual money.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The game isn't exactly the most fun. Like so many games released for iOS and those then ported to OS X, the game forces you to wait massive periods of time for no reason other than to force you into buying things with real money. It just nickels and dimes you endlessly, at least if you want to play for more than ten minutes once every 24 hours. These games are all essentially a step down from the shareware of the past.<br/><br/>The game's graphics aren't that nice. While on the town screen, it looks fine. In combat, however, the low quality images become a bit uglier. If you play in full screen, they're just bad. You can't even use the scrollwheel on many things, such as the build depot. The game's icon is simply the one used on iOS and doesn't match how icons on OS X should look.<br/><br/>The game is fun enough at first, then it devolves into drudgery. It's ultimately no different from any Facebook game out there. In the end, I don't see these issues ever getting fixed. Fixing these things would mean losing the incentive to pay for the most basic things.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0

"It's a fun game - I found it quite addictive. But after a certain point you cannot do much in the game at all unless you use Investment Points. You can obtain a very few of these per day, and youcan purchase them for real money. I purchased hundreds of them and continued playing, but then the game started revealing bugs, making it unplayable; some quests qould require me to transport 100 (for example) people to a location. If I left the game running and in the foreround (i.e., I could not use my computer for anything else, and I could not let it sleep or go to screensaver) then it would work, but if I put the game in the background, mimimized it, or quit it and relaunched it later (which it is supposed to handle properly), then the quest says I have transported *negative billions* of people! There is no way to catch up! Other quests became unplayable in different manners: one said to route a bus through every location; I did, but the quest did not recognize it, so there is no way to achieve that quest!<br/><br/>Tech support said, &quot;sorry. wait for an upgrade that might fix it.&quot;<br/><br/>I do *NOT* recommend paying any money in order to play this game (or to try to play it!).

But the rate at which gems can be earned and the rate at which they are spent has caused me to have to purchase gems a coupe of times this month.

"This game is fun.  The dungeons are immersive and remind me of traditional MMO dungeons.  This is because it feels like a gaming world.  That said, there are no country sides to roam or towns to explore.  You are either in your tavern to sell and buy things (or someone else's tavern if you play online) or you are in the midst of battle.<br/><br/>There is something tangible to this game: this means you upgrade gear, you upgrade your character stats, and you can change your toon's appearance.  It's like other MMOs in that sense.  However, there are few gear slots, and, other than weapons, gear is not visible when worn.<br/><br/>This review would have recieved five stars, but it will not because of some bugs: online game play yeilds spotty connections sometimes, the option to view and join current online games does not work, it is not a smooth transition between the game world and the game menus, and there is no in-game friend window because you'll have to use Game Center to invite/add friends to play in your same dungeon instance.<br/><br/>But the game play is very fun.  There are some unique twists to the classes available that help to give variety to play styles--my favorite being the summoner who, for lack of a better term, plays God over an army of minions, and a robot who builds laser beams and reflecting walls.<br/><br/>If you like Defender Chronicles and Field Runners, but you love games like WoW and EQ, you would have fun playing Dungeon Defenders.  Just be warned: your original $15 to buy the game from the app store gives you four classes/avatars and a mere several instances to choose from.  All other content and classes--and there are quite a few--will cost you more money via in-game purchases.  <br/><br/>Worth it all IMO. One of the biggest draws to this game is that it's a good place for casual gamers.  Just beware, although you do not have to spend hours and hours playing to advance, when you sit down to play after dinner, in a blink of an eye it's already past your bedtime.<br/><br/>One more thing: it makes my iMac run hot--very, very, very hot.

"Why all the games have to be structured in this weird way confounds me. What city in the world have you ever been to that was built by starting a cab company and then constructing buildings based on that? Makes absolutely no sense whatsover. To go to this extent to make a game like this, you would've thought they would've created a few more options of different ways and means of various careers in life to move up the ladder of society to build one's own city. So, because of the strange way in which you have to collect game dollars in this game at the beginning, you are forced into playing it the ONE way they want you to play which, to me, defeats te purpose of wanting to build one's own city in any way shape or form possible and you feel cagey after about the first hour of playing this game because you're just doing the same thing over and over again without much progress. So, it's just OK. Especially when you have to then spend real money to make any real progress in the game.

"Now I'm no expert but I can tell when a game has potential.<br/><br/>Music: Repetitive, boring, a bit annoying. 3/5<br/>Gameplay: No plot or storyline, just passing through Day stages: repetitive, but still fun if you're into the endless stages type of game (which I'm not). However, the weapons are nice, and you have a wide variety of good looking weapons and characters that you can unlock and choose from. Also, there's co-op mode, so I'll give it four stars.  4/5<br/>Graphics: Cute and cartoonish, hence call of MINI. The graphics suit it's purpose. 5/5<br/>Overall: Nice game with greate potential. 4/5<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Unlike most games, you dont have to pay any REAL money. You can unlock everything with in-game cash. However, you CAN buy in-game cash for real money.<br/>-There's co-op mode. Playing with friends or people online is fun.<br/>-Overall great graphics.<br/>-Smooth gameplay.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Some items are pretty expensive. Like another reviewer explained, it costs $9.99 to buy 15 seconds worth of flamethrower ammo. That's a bit crazy if you ask me.<br/>-Co-op mode needs a chat, in both the lobby and the co-op battle.<br/>-More people need to buy this game! I'm sick of waiting 15 minutes to join a co-op battle.<br/>-The music needs some… refining, please.<br/>-There's no quit option.

This could be the best game of the year but it requires excessive amounts of gems to proceed eg 200 gems to fix a bridge to rescue an animal when u can only find 5 gems in a crate and one if you use all your food to scavenge.

"I really liked the game.  I have never purchased beans, yet was been able to play almost to the top tier.  The way to get beans without paying for them is to watch 20-30 second advertisements that they offer (on the iPhone version - not available on the computer version).  They have since stopped most of the advertising, so now one cannot play very far without actually paying for &quot;beans&quot; (their version of currency).  So what's wrong with that?<br/><br/>Well, the game has many bugs.  It takes a while for them to fix the bugs, but then new ones pop up.  Its like they don't properly test the fixes.  If I pay money for &quot;beans&quot; so I can play the game, it is no longer a free game and should be held to a higher standard.  I could forgive the bugs while playing for free, but once I invest money into a game, it should be quality controlled much better than this one is.<br/><br/>They no longer have a &quot;deal of the day&quot; that allows one to purchase items at a discount - forcing people who want to advance further to buy more beans (for more real money).  All but the smallest warehouses require purchase with beans and warehouses rate needed to advance to higher levels.  So to advanced beyond the very basic start of the game, one needs the beans.  With little (or no) advertising to watch, one cannot get enough &quot;free&quot; beans to really do anything.<br/><br/>If you want to play something as a distraction for a week or so, this is a good game.

"Not a bad game; it's fun to watch your city take shape (including traffic jams). However, many of the improvements take a lot of invest points, and it takes forever to accumulate points, unless you buy them. I don't see the point of spending real money to play, so I haven't tried the in-game purchases.<br/><br/>Update: since the 1.7.5 update I haven't been able to open the game. It gets about a third of the way through loading my city, then freezes. <br/><br/>Good thing this is free…",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"TLDR Version: Dear Developers -- Please, please, please, let me trade my city credits for investment points!!<br/><br/>Long Version: You need &quot;investment points&quot; in order to expand your territory, remove land obstacles like hills, and start certain projects.  The game's developers really want you to buy these points from their store, which I understand, but they've gone way too far in that direction.  It is nearly impossible to expand your city without shelling out $1 here, $5 there, and so on.  City credits accumulate quickly but your city ends up getting bottlenecked because of how hard it is to get investment points without paying real money for them.<br/><br/>This flaw keeps me from enjoying the game as much as I otherwise would (since SimCity is one of my favorite games, but so hard to find for the Mac) and I'll probably stop playing once the interest starts to fade or I get too frustrated from having to pay $5 every time I want to grow my city.  If the developers would make it easier to get investment points, I'd rate 5 stars and probably never stop playing while my real life goes to crap.  (Can't ... shower ... Must ... reroute ... trucks ... and ... build ... another ... park ...)<br/><br/>I'm not saying it should be as easy as earning city credits, since I would have been more than willing to pay $15 or $20 to get the game instead of going freemium.  The developers should make money off their work.  But the difficulty in acquiring investment points is set too high -- it doesn't build loyalty and to be honest it's getting pretty frustrating.<br/><br/>Why not give investment points along with energy when completing the missions, or better yet: Establish a bank where I can buy investment points with my city credits!  I have five million city credits, but nothing to do with them since I can't expand without paying more money.  Why not let me exchange two million city credits for twenty investment points?  That change alone would make this game nearly perfect, and keep me playing for a long time to come.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"This game can be pretty fun and rewarding. I've played both Virtual City 1 &amp; 2, and I think that they had to set up the game like this if they were ever going to make any money (it's free, but there are a in-app purchases). You have to buy a few more things in this one--like land or unlocked features (which you use your investor credits for; you're given a small starting amount, but if you want more, you have to post things to fb, complete tasks, or pay real money for them).  One gripe I wish they would have dealt with: You can't move things after you build. If you put down a building or any feature whatsoever, it either stays there or gets bulldozed (if you need the space). Nothing can be rotated, nothing can be moved. Boo to that. Otherwise, it's a fun time-waster that keeps playing when you've actually shut things down (the next time you come back to it, your income has skyrocketed!).",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Really, this is a pretty amazing game. Resource management mixed with turn based fighting. I do have a few gripes though.<br/><br/>First, connection. This game requires an internet connection to play. Okay, not a big deal. At least until you discover that the program has trouble keeping a stable connection to its servers for more than a few minutes. The game almost constatnly times out, making you wait for the game to re-connect to play. This intrupts me so much, it gets rather annoying to play.<br/><br/>Next, the battles… These are amazing, except for one little detail. Everything just seems too weak. Even the most expensive units go down with a few hits in battle, making them almost constantly need repair. These costs quickly start to exceed the prize money from winning a battle, which puts you out of commision. I can't even keep the people off of my land because by the time I'm done saving money to heal my key units from one battle and actually healing them, two more sets of invaders have appeared at the base!<br/><br/>My last complaint is that some of the missions ask you to buy/build things that require Nanopods to get. NanoPods, are the currency that you have to pay real money to get, meaning that to get rid of the icon, you have to pay them money. Sometimes, this icon can even block another from appearing, because there's no more room for new missions! If you are going to ask us to complete missions that require NanoPods, then give us the nanopods to do it, or at least a slightly easier way to get them in game.",0,0,0,1,1,0,0

"Been playing for few years now &amp; have to say I'm becoming quite frustrated with quality of game operations...especially app for iOS.

Considering searching for a new game if not at least playable 50% of the time real soon...not enough time in life for anyone to put up with these terrible &quot;glitches&quot;, especially for a game that costs so much real money, and so timely to play.

"Okay, first thing to address: I almost didn't get this because I have an ipad mini, and a lot of prior reviews said it didn't work. However, I love this game so much that I decided to try it anyways. I buy apps with survey rewards (quick thoughts app), so I figured I wouldn't actually lose any real money.<br/><br/>The game DOES work on my Mini. There was one time that it closed, which was the beginning of the cutscene immediately after the tutorial stage. Since then, working perfectly! If you have trouble, double tap your home button and close all other running apps.<br/><br/>Now, on to the game. The only differences between this and the console/pc versions are: less varied maps, slightly reduced graphics, and price. This is by far one of the best things you can by on the App Store and I will always support good ports like this, because I want more of them!<br/><br/>Controls work great, however they take a minute or two to get used to. Sometimes you may send a soldier a space or two away from where you wanted, but if you're careful this should never happen.<br/><br/>Graphics-wise, the game looks great even without a retina display. There is very little frame rate loss during character movement, although there is noticeable stutter at times, especially when there is explosions or lots of activity.<br/><br/>In closing, this game is a must-have for anyone who wants more than just Fruit Ninja or in app purchase games that drain your wallet. This one time price of $20 is worth every penny. Thanks to the xcom folks for this one!",0,1,0,0,1,0,0

"Honestly, it's not worth $10. At all. The game is slow, glitchy, and overall, disapointing. The game just froze my entire computer, and very little seeming to be happening on the game. The game is very restricting in terms of what you can and can't do, and the times for &quot;expert&quot; in some cases seem completely rediculous. These are major issues that can simply not be overlooked. Even the &quot;Virtual City: Playground&quot; game that is constantly asking you for more real money, is a better value than this, despite how essential the &quot;Invest Points&quot; are and how hard it is to get them. Wait for some more updates to this game before you buy, if you do at all.<br/><br/>Again, a &quot;freeplay&quot;/&quot;playground&quot; mode would be appreciated, and make the game a great value, but the issues with how the game runs need to be fixed first before there's anything worth improving.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0

"This is not a bad game. It's no SimCity, but it comes pretty close. Since it's a free game, with little things you can buy with real money in it, it's another one of those freemium games, but that doesn't make it bad. If anything, there's something mildly enjoyable about watching a city grow because of business and capitalism.<br/><br/>So here's some good points about it.<br/><br/>It's Free.<br/><br/>It's entertaining, if you don't mind waiting in real time to earn a lot of money.<br/><br/>It keeps track of how much you earn, even when the app is closed, or not running.<br/><br/>Here's some of the bad stuff though.<br/><br/>There's some bugs.<br/><br/>You have to post to Facebook/twitter or what have you, in order to actually build anything cool.<br/><br/>It's a freemium game.<br/><br/>The freemiums are almost game-breaking. Instantly giving you a butt-load of coins and 'investment points' so that you can build your Super Stadium feels a bit like cheating, since you didn't really have to work for the stuff it took to build it.<br/><br/>All in all though, it's not a bad game, and it's good for killing half an hour every few hours.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Come on Apple and Zynga.....<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Another trash of an update!  Just loaded the latest version crashes every time I try to load it...tried it three times now.  Sick of Farmville. You do every dang update but what ppl actually want. If I could send this with NO stars I would. <br/><br/>Sorry review submitters for having to read all my lengthy  disappointments below but you have to wonder if they read these and listen to us!  Apparently NOT!!!!  <br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>As you can see from my lengthy previous comments below, this app is still JUNK! For two days now it won't even load. WASTE of all our time!  Still can't play like you can on computer so it's worthless!  Disgusted with this app. <br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>This app continues to be junk. HELLO are you folks at FV reading our comments?????<br/><br/>This game needs to be like the Internet!!!  Fix these issues, id like to get off the home screen and see my farm load.  <br/><br/>And stop telling me that I need more neighbors for everything I'd like to upgrade to. Your stuff is way put of reach and the only way you can make a decent farm is my spending real money to get play money for a GAME!!!?  What a pity!...For instance $9 FV bucks for a little cat?  You have any idea how long it even takes to build up that cash when trying to improve your farm.......as I've repeated over and over...THIS IS NOT 24/7 FARMING ON THE GO... You still need a PC to do half of what you want/need to do!  This is BS!<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>This app is junk!  For two days I can't get past the home screen and when I could play it, it wouldn't allow me to fertilize my neighbors farms find anything on my farm and the such...JUNK. Not to mention everything you want is so expensive. This is a GAME!  Make it playable. Not about to use real money to get PLAY money!

When I'm sitting in the middle of a beach playing FV like I would at my computer... then that's farming!!!!  <br/><br/>This continues to NEED a link back to news feed to collect on animals and other great finds!  How frustrating is it when your friends find a lonely animal or something and you can't get it without running to a computer...that's just stupid!<br/><br/>Unlock the gifts and all the things in the market!!!!  I can't even build my beehive cause I can't use all my stuff playing on iPhone. And I'd like to be able to send things to all my neighbors. Not everyone has an iPhone!!!<br/><br/>You do updates but where are the improvements???  And this constant out of sync is getting old now!!!!!  Not to mention the constant frozen screen.

Good luck playing this game past level 12 or 13 without investing money for the nanopods. The items you have to purchase require lots of coins and resources and there's no way of building the required buildings or units without spending real money on fake money.

"If you love games that make you think and that always give you something new to think about, buy this game.  The learning curve is steep, but climbing up the hill is alot of fun too.  Complete victory usually requires achieving some objective while suffering less than a specified percentage friendly casualties and inflicting a certain percentage of enemy casualties within a specified period of time.  You have to solve a variety of tactical and strategic problems to achieve a balanced result.  So the learning curve not only includes getting used to command interface; it also requires some hard-headed analysis and the willingness to take a few risks during a game.  There are dozens of different ways to approach a battle, to which corresponds a hefty set of possible commands that takes a while to learn.  The command interface is fairly intuitive.   But successful strategic and tactical problem solving requires more than an intuitive feel or familarity with first-person shoot'm ups..  Fortunately, you can experiement by re-playing the same battle multiple times.  The artificial intelligence powering the game is very good.  You don't have to tell your soldiers everything, and enemy soldiers are capable always capable of surprising you with a move you may not have anticipated.  If you like history, there is a whole other level to this game.  The in-game campaigns strive for hisroical authenticity. I like the graphics.  Battle fields contain  many details that make a difference,  You have to study them.  Battle sounds carry information not just ambience.  Customer service is great too.  I don't play many video games.  I have been playing this one for only a few weeks.  I have a lot to learn. Am I having fun!",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"the game could be way better. however, it's gameplay is designed to manipulate you into spending actual money-- else, the game can get rather slow and boring, and you have to wait awhile if you're not willing to. the game is structured into a binding, mandated strategy of set, '&quot;goals,&quot; you complete for rewards of 'credits,' (coins), and 'invest points,' (tickets). Some things cost a lot of coins, somethings cost SEVERAL tickets. You can only receive tickets as rewards for completing goals, some of which you need tickets for to complete in the first place. Ticket rewards are always very frugal. There are things you can do with coins, but they're limited. The requirement for tickets will leave you with a LOT of time on your hands to wait. its also irritating that while youre away, your enery has a ceiling as to how far itll regenerate. <br/><br/>If you won't comply with this game's strategy to get you to spend real money, the game gets old fast because of all the time you have to do waiting.<br/>I'm at the point where I check it a few times a day to do what I'm then able to do (after the game has had HOURS to make me the money needed to complete one goal).<br/><br/>ANOTHER THING that is HIGHLY aggravating<br/>I don't have a Facebook, fools. I may be 22 but I'm over that crap, I deactivated my FB and I have no desire to partake in that social platform again. Same with twitter.<br/><br/>This game bugs you to take pictures of your city and share them with your friends. Even if I had FB, I don't give a flying crap enough to post on my FB my little starting up virtual city. And I definitely wouldn't want to see that janx on my other friends walls. I could care less about ya'lls little computer game, you think I want to see a screenshot? I don't need to ask to know that that's how most of my friends feel as well. <br/>However, because the whole &quot;take a picture and post it to facebook!&quot; is one of the game's actual GOALS, it's won't shut up about it. It even freaking repeats the demand in the form of two separate goals! Even though they're literally exactly the same thing! Like shut up how desperate are you!!! If you relied on the gameplay and not word-of-mouth for business, maybe it'd make ya'll focus more on the gameplay and you could actually improve it!<br/><br/>Two stars for the aspects that are free. And better graphics than what zynga would've bothered with.<br/><br/>*****EDIT** I haven't played this game in several WEEKS, and probably won't ever again. You DO hit a dead-end with this game; there comes a point where, if you've been playing the game without making any in-app purchaces, you've more or less completed the goals they've given you and only have the ones that cost invest points left. because of the game structure, there are no new components or challenges to partake in; I can either collect about one invest point a day, until I accrue the dozens and dozens needed for a 'Big Ben Clock Tower' goal (build a clock tower, thats it),  all while literally doing nothing since I've basically already done everything possible in the game and now can only spend my time re-doing the layout of my city… <br/>or i can put it on the shelf and say, this game's over. this isnt one you can just keep playing.<br/><br/>(also, it's march, they still haven't updated and still have all this holiday janx going on like we're back in christmas, they've failed to update other pieces of the game that feature things that say '2012' (yeah, it's 2013 now)… looks like this game was as forgettable to the developers as it was to us!<br/><br/>it lasted about a month or so.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0

"First off, we all know that this is no Sim City.  But, who cares?  let's judge this one on its own merit.  Hrmm... what shall I include?  That you can't rotate buildings?  This is incredibly frustrating, as each building needs to be next to a road, but some building have to have the road on a specific side.  Why should this matter?  Why not just expand, expand, expand?  The game has this rediculous program of 'Invest Points,' which are nearly impossible to accrue.  Every time you expand, not only do you have to pay more money, but the number of Invest Points increases exponentially.  This is a good idea, if you're trying to trap people into shelling out real money in the app store, but since there's a glitch in the programming, I can't.  Y'all's loss.

"this virtual city game has some of the staples, particularly those of modern free apps; resource management- currency comes in two forms, the other, more valuable form that allows more is more difficult to attain (and both are available for purchase with real money), environment, population, buildings and activities that take real time to complete, and tasks for you to complete to help your city move along the way but also at times try to motivate you to buy costly things. <br/><br/>this game is more enjoyable, however, and isnt too difficult to manage without pressure of spending real money. i say this because it can keep you occupied literally every few minutes because the game operates on contracts you buy to get tasks done that often earn profit and EXP and other items…. more on those items in a bit. and these contracts can literally last only a couple minutes. they can last longer, but you can always choose the quicker option. <br/><br/>anyways, these items. that's one thing that knocked off a star for me. to hire the people necessary for the contracts, you have to collect these items from them that you get at random from certain tasks. the thing is, since it's at random, you can go awhile without getting them. even if you do the specifc tasks required for the item, it doesn't mean you'll get it. this can mean waiting awhile for chance. for example, you may need to hire a referee to open a sports arena. say you need three items for the ref (i cant remember on the top of my head, making this up): a yellow card, a whistle, and a jersey. i havent gotten around to a sports arena yet and have already picked up about 60 yellow cards. meanwhile, i have like 3 buildings that have been waiting to open since nearly the beginning of the game, and i still cant open because i cant get the items.<br/>this can be frustrating, impeding, and obnoxious. it seems to be a bit of a ploy-- you either have to keep building the things that will try to get you the items, forcing you to need to expand/etc, thus needing more money (thus possibly spending real money), or just going ahead and dropping your actual cash to speed things up.<br/><br/>the game can always keep you occupied with little collections, but it can get old when you want to be able to start doing other things.<br/><br/>the graphics are decent but nothing amazing. there are some things that are blurry and pixelated, even without you zooming in. once you've had a lot of buildings/contracts going, it can be rather demanding to have to click on all the buildings to collect profit. it got to the point for me where it'd take me over five minutes. do people really want to spend their time having to deal with that on a game? i had low tolerance for it; there is an option to 'collect all profits immediately,' but it costs those rare country bucks, which the game really wants you to spend actual money on.<br/><br/>its a decent city game. it can pass your time for sure",0,0,0,0,1,1,0

"This really would be a great game if the developer didn't make it so hard to build.  Some buildings are payed for with city credits, which is just like money.

The only way to earn Invest Points is to buy them with iTunes money, posting to Facebook (which I don't have), and making it to the next level in the game.  It's almost impossible to make it to the next level without spending real money to buy Invest Points.  Therefore this game is NOT FREE.  Invest Points ruin the game.

There is no challenge to this, and it is a pain because this and many other games make it extra difficult to succeed because they want your money. I do not know how people have billions of city cash, or why they care since they clearly are not spending it anyway, but as a new player I am annoyed that I can not turn off the spending money or connecting to facebook advertisements. This game could be fun, but they need to stop programming to become rich and start programming to entertain and challenge people. Three stars because it is fun but the loss of two because its also really annoying. I also wish i could adjust the zoom of the map on screen.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"My previous review on here was removed by iTunes saying it violated TOS (which includes profanity, spam, etc and no details of said offense) none of which of course, was in the previous review.  As I had many &quot;helpful&quot; ratings for the previous review and it was quite negative toward the company I have a very sneaking suspicion….  <br/><br/>Prominently, there was a &quot;Christmas Tree Fiasco&quot; (among other similar fiascos apparently that occur every so often with this company), players &quot;bought&quot; with virtual coins a Christmas Tree that was to give a bonus with no cap in the description (some items descriptions include bonus caps such as saying &quot;only 1 will provide bonus&quot;).  Without getting into detail, many people paid Real Life Money to make room to accomodate more trees for the great bonus.  Upon realizing customers were stacking up on the bonus the company pulled the bonus and did not make right customers to their status before the(ir) error.  So people destroyed land designs, removed or sold things they bought with RL MONEY to make room for the trees, got rid of other bonus items, and on and on.  The company was fine giving you back all the fake virtual gold you wanted but when it came to giving you back items PAID for or refunding any REAL money all of a sudden they &quot;couldn't do it.&quot;  Many customers came on here completely dissatisfied by the company's reaction and complete lack of care for their customers and wrote reviews.  Oddly enough, a bunch of one or two line 5 star reviews started popping up around the same time.  iTunes needs a system like &lt;that other review company&gt; to filter out fake reviews.    <br/><br/>If you do decide to download this app, DO NOT waste your money buying anything that causes you to spend RL money.  You will regret it, just wait and see.  Or if you really really really want to wait until you get to the end or at least higher levels so you don't end up buying items with real money for bonus that you end up having to replace in the higher levels.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Love to play this but it costs way too much real money if you want to advance in the game.  Crystals are few and far between and you need hundreds to continue the rescues.  Suggest maybe challenging games where you can win enough crystals to build a bridge or expand your land etc.  If not for the crystal issue I would definately give the game 5 stars,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

You always get to assign trucks, dump trucks and buses to routes for transporting goods, removing trash from business and houses and moving people to stores and big events.<br/><br/>The only issues I found kind of annoying was the Invest points.

"I REALLY enjoy the game and am glad that I bought it. It's a great way to learn poker without having to pay an arm a leg losing real money, but there have had a few problems. First, I can't seem to change my picture and the advice from support said the command was under the Main menu; however, there is no &quot;Main&quot; menu in the Mac version nor can I find any command that lets me change the picture. Second, my first $50k tournament was interupted by a problem connecting. I couldn't seem to reconnect in Pokerist but was able to connect to Web sites with my browser.

However, it is hard to make strategic decisions when Geek Beach does not say how the order of attacks is decided or how they decide who gets put to sleep, who gets poisoned, etc.<br/><br/>This makes it very frustrating and puts the game more towards the &quot;random luck&quot; type of game than actually strategy.

"I am a business person, so I seriously limit the amount of friends I have on Facebook.  I find it rude that you need to have a specific amount of friends connected to farm ville to get more land it is just crap.  Plus fuel.  I am not paying real cash to play an online game.  I use my iPad and rarely use my workstations at work or home.  So the desktop browser version of the game apparently has options to get fuel differently, but why not include that pivotal functionality in the iPad app.  Basically, don't force the professionally prudent to waste money on your game.  In two months if there isn't a fix I'm quitting farm ville cuz I'll need more land and I'm not going to pay real money.  Use paradise island as an example just make it more expensive in gold coin without friends.  Love the idea, but bad execution zynga.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0

"I've had this game for a few weeks now, and it's really an incredible game. The controls are perfect; best dual-stick control there is. Awesome graphics and sound effects, too.2 complaints, however:1) The game gets way too difficult, way too fast. So much stuff coming at you, and you can only take 2 hits (one hit, shield gone; second hit, boom). The difficulty ramp is just too high. The game could use difficulty settings (ie: easy, normal, hard).2) The biggest gripe I have? The game crashes every other level. It didn't at first, but after the first update I received, it crashed constantly. The latest update said it contained &quot;crash and bug fixes&quot; yet it crashes just as much as it did before, if not more. Sometimes it lets you resume at the last finished level, sometimes not; but it's just REALLY annoying regardless.All in all, a great game.

Whats with the few and far between investment points? You should be able to spend some of your city money on investment points because I have $2 million and cant do anything with it because I am in need of investment points. It would also be nice if your energies didnt stop at 60. It is so easy to use up all the energies on upgrades and building projects and if they loaded up overnight or whatever I wouldnt be at a standstill for so long. Its fun but gets frustrating when you cant do anything and then you have to spend real money to do anything.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Shadow Era is great for scratching that CCG itch when you don't have one of your buddies around to play with. It looks really nice, plays smoothly, and is totally worth at least trying, given its price of free. It's not quite everything it seems to be cracked up to be though. Some of the influences of other games are really strong *cough*WoWTCG*cough*. When playing online, the fairly limited card pool (which should be expanding) means that pretty much all the competitive players are playing almost identical decks, which isn't very exciting, especially if you started with one of the decks that didn't have a lot of those cards in it. This problem is esaxperated by how difficult obtaining new cards is. Gold and the points for booster packs and decks accumulate slowly (unless you're willing to pay real money). Fortunately, that problem is the biggest, and it's not hard to look past as long as you're not expecting an experience as thouroughly done as Magic Online.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
