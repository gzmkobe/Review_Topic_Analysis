"I love having the New Yorker content in an app, but the design of this app tries too hard to be different. Some examples:<br/>1. When I single-tap while in the app, I expect to see the iOS top bar w/ the clock, battery life, etc. Having to exit the app just to check the time is distracting &amp; annoying.<br/>2. Support the &quot;double-tap at the top to scroll up&quot; feature. When I get to the end of an article, I often want to scroll back to the top to see the author's name or the article photo. Having to scroll back up through 51 pages of article kills the thumbs.<br/>3. Why do short articles scroll normally, but long articles scroll in pages? Just let everything scroll normally - the paging feels too short anyway.<br/>4. For articles that page, that center-bottom &quot;Share&quot; menu is such a distraction. Show it only on single-tap - there's no reason to waste screen space displaying it all the time.<br/>5. Support iPhone 5 already!",0,1,1,0,0,1,0

"I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth the $20, but it is, without a doubt! The game is challenging, interesting, and beautiful. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a console quality game on mobile devices, and worth every penny.<br/><br/>That said, it strains any device using an A5 processor to its absolute limits. I'm playing on an iPad mini and I can tell its working hard. While it runs very well, with minimal frame rate drops or skipping in cut scenes, it would certainly be better on an iPad using the A6X processor. Though it might be possible to play this on an iPhone 5, I would recommend it. I haven't tried it on mine, but there's so much going on that you will need the additional screen space.<br/><br/>Going hand-in-hand with the resource intensity is the enormous batter drain. I get GREAT battery life on my iPad mini (~10 hrs) and this is just burning through the charge. Playing today for about 2 hours took me from ~50% to 10%.<br/><br/>Another warning: turn off your notifications before you play on A5 device. It booted me out of the game and I lost some (but not much) progress in a mission. I'm not sure how often it auto-saves, locally or to the cloud, but I'm certainly glad that it does.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this a great game and well worth the price.

"Found is a great search app, easily accessed by double-tapping the &quot;control&quot; key.

"This app is pretty pointless. There is no way to save lyrics and you need an internet connection each time a song changes and it has to look up the lyrics (say bye to your battery life). It seems to cache the lyrics it already finds but still tried to connect to another server. It looks like the company likes to keep track of what you are listening to, because there is no other reason to make an internet connection after it alreadty has the lyrics. Also, the company website loads 4 cookies. 3 of them are tracking cookies. That means there is a good chance that the company is using the info it gathers on listening habits to better target advertising at you, and others like you, if you use it in conjunction with an online music service, or if identifies you for any other info it gathers.<br/><br/>If it just did its job and grabbed lyrics it would be 2 stars because it is just mediocre: the font is horribly renderdd: we are talking Windows 95 logo quality here, not the nice antialiasing we're used to.

This is a cool app that works great on the iPhone 5s. It harnesses the M7 on the phone so it doesn't drain the battery like other fitness/pedometer apps that use GPS.

"I like it. It's a cool way to track my health related activities. When I first installed it the app pulled up the last seven days of the steps I've taken. I assume it pulled the info off of the M7 chip, which tells me that the M7 logs info whether or not an app requires it, since a argus was the first app that did. That also tells me that argus shouldn't affect battery life by using the M7 either.<br/><br/>For users having issues with battery life you should know that ios7 has many settings that can effect the longevity of your battery. If you just updated to ios7 without checking into these settings then you are missing out. You can set which apps use gps, which apps continue working in the background when you aren't using them, and whether or not your apps update automatically. All of these things can drain your battery when you don't want them to. <br/><br/>Lastly, I subtracted one star from Argus because to get the full functionality that Argus offers you need a few more certain apps that each cost a few more dollars. One for the heart rate monitor (which is pretty cool BTW), one for measuring your workouts (called Instant Fitness), and one for tracking your sleep (I don't think it's necessary). You can enter the measurements that these extra apps record manually but I don't know how to figure out the measurements without the apps beyond just a vague guess.

"I have been a long time print subscriber, and have been using the iPad version for a year now. There are a few fatal flaws in this app, I assumed they would get fixed at some point but they haven't.<br/><br/>First, you can't download the issues in the background. In fact, you can't even walk away while while it downloads. If the iPad goes to sleep, the download pauses. Sometimes it has to start over again from scratch. I get to stare at a download progress bar for at east five minutes each week.<br/><br/>Second, someone needs to look at the basic interface- it always tells me to subscribe, even though I am subscribed and I'm logged in. Simple simple fix, but the programmers obviously don't care enough to check their work.<br/><br/>Third, I agree with other reviews here, the audio interface needs to remember where you left off.<br/><br/>There are a host of other annoying little details that need to be finished and addressed.

"I love the New Yorker, but they approach their iPad app pretty much the way you'd expect a bunch of dead-tree professionals who are still wrapping their heads around this whole &quot;tablet&quot; thing to. As others mentioned, they have made the inane decision to basically publish each issue as a massive image. As a result, as others have mentioned, each issue is massive -- like, 200 mb. Which makes it impractical to download over a 3G connection while traveling, and even over wifi it takes a good long time to download (and of course, the download can't work in the background while the app is closed, so you need to sit there with the app open for like 5 mins each time).<br/><br/>Secondly, because everything's an image, the text quality is terrible on the new iPad.<br/><br/>Hopefully they will fix this by rebuilding the app and publishing issues in HTML, which will fix both these problems (god forbid let's hope they don't fix this by just increasing the resolution on the image files...

"This review addresses the iPad format of the magazine, not the magazine content, which is unquestionably 5-star. <br/><br/>It is a shame that Conde Nast has chosen to publish their magazines, including the New Yorker, so poorly for the iPad. The magazine essentially consists of several large images, which means:<br/>- Each issue is a massive file that takes a long time to download, even on WiFi<br/>- Most of the magazine is a typographical nightmare and looks terrible on the new retina display<br/>- Most of the text is not selectable. (Presumably, this is intend to make it more difficult to copy and share articles.)<br/><br/>This is a very backwards approach to the iPad.

You don't have to buy anything to be good at this game and can be equal with everyone else. (I.e. if &quot;expand&quot; were unlimited use, anybody willing to spend a bunch of money would easily have the highest scores.) The latest update let's you change dot color sets and play multiplayer, nice additions. My only suggestion would be to create a multiplayer option via any players online and not just on the same phone. Otherwise this game is fun and beautifully designed - developers, please don't change a thing on the iPhone version! Everyone else, download and enjoy!",0,1,0,0,1,1,0

"This game is amazingly addictive! Thanks to the creators! One problem now though - my zombies no longer take commands. Basically makes playing the game pretty impossible.

"Love the game once I figured out the ways to get more points.  That could be explained better.  My main complaint is there is no way to drop games when people don't respond.  The time should be shorter or there needs to be a way to close the game when there is no return play. Plus, when games are frozen there is no way to get rid of them. This should be a quick fix by your programmers.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Most buildings cost real money to open, because only 2 of the 3 items ever show up. Also, I really think the developers have checked out... No updates to fix problems, and it still has a Christmas theme that you can't get rid of. I don't mind the developers making money, but the costs of advancing in this game are way overpriced. The crashes without saving has caused me to stop using the app, I don't have the problem with any other app on my iPad.

"I've been playing this for a couple of months now, and it is very fun.

I made mining equipment self powered, enhanced my howitzer, and spent the rest in the plasma rifle. That was when I was level ~20, now I'm 64 and rising, to get the latest update.<br/><br/>Since the co op update, the start screen has lost it's typical box or metal design to cardinal directions as the faces, during co op all buttons(on the selection bar at the bottom, all options, and the 'are you sure you want to quit' box background) are invisible instead showing through the canvas to the world map below. Additionally, when trying to get set up for co op all buttons and options are either invisible showing the abbreviated names of guns, or more likely something in the button class went wrong resulting in both 'flat plains' and 'mni' or other gun names. While playing, the typical crosshair is replaced with two horizontal rectangles, albeit that may be intentional because they still act appropriately.<br/><br/>I still give the game 5 stars because although now more graphically flawed, the game still functions and it is an amazingly fun game.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0
